                    <p>Hello and Thank you for visiting our web page.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        When I first got a 3d printer, my wife asked me to print a temple. Once I did, she wondered if
                        some
                        people
                        would also like to get a 3d printed temple. She posted the temple I printed on facebook market
                        place
                        and ...
                        <br><br>
                        We started to receive order. We never imagine that so many people would also like a temple so we
                        decided to invest
                        on another 3d printer and we started to print many different temples.
                        <br><br>
                        It has been a couple of months and we are still making many different temples of different
                        sizes.
